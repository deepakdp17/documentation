                    <p>Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and 
                        interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented 
                        programming approach to develop applications. 
                        It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.
                        Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, 
                        which makes it attractive for Application Development.

                        Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.
                        The implementation of Python was started in December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.
                        In February 1991, Guido Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.
                        ABC programming language is said to be the predecessor of Python language, which was capable 
                        of Exception Handling and interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System.

                            In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.

                            On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was designed to 
                            rectify the fundamental flaw of the language.

                        You can learn python from scratch. Python is easier to learn because of its 
                        simple syntax, vast library. It is a open source means you don't have to pay 
                        single penny. This is website developed for both beginners and professionals.
                        It would be better you know one of the programming language like c,c++,c#,java,
                        etc.. It makes you learn quicker and easier to understand the concepts.

                                The CAD (Computer-aided design) is used to design engineering related architecture. 
                                It is used to develop the 3D representation of a part of a system. 
                                Python can create a 3D CAD application by using the following functionalities.

                        Variable is a name that is used to refer to memory location. Python variable is also known 
                        as an identifier and used to hold value.
                        In Python, we don't need to specify the type of variable because Python is a infer language 
                        and smart enough to get variable type.
                        Variable names can be a group of both the letters and digits, but they have to begin with 
                        a letter or an underscore.
                        Since python is case sensitive it is recommended to use lowercase letters for the variable name.

                            The first character of the variable must be an alphabet or underscore ( _ ).

                        Variables can hold values, and every value has a data-type. Python is a dynamically typed language; 
                        hence we do not need to define the 
                        type of the variable while declaring it. The interpreter implicitly binds the value with its type.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        a=5
                        b=2.6
                        string="10"
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Variable a holds the integer value 5, b holds float value 2.6 and variable string holds string value 5.
                        we did not define its type. Python interpreter will automatically interpret variables a as an integer type.
                        Python enables us to check the type of the variable used in the program. Python provides us the type() function, 
                        which returns the type of the variable passed.

                        Python Keywords are special reserved words that convey a special meaning to the compiler/interpreter. 
                        Each keyword has a special meaning and a specific operation. 
                        These keywords can't be used as a variable. Following is the List of Python Keywords.

                    Python Literals can be defined as data that is given in a variable or constant.
                    <br/>Python supports the following literals:
                    <ol type="1">
                       <li ::maker>
                            <h4>String Literals</h4>
                            String literals can be formed by enclosing a text in the quotes. 
                            We can use both single as well as double quotes to create a string.
                            <br/><br/>types of literals are:-
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li ::maker>

                                        Strings that are terminated within a single-line are known as Single line Strings.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>A piece of text that is written in multiple lines is known as multiple lines string.<br/>
                                        There are two ways to create multiline strings:

                            Python contains one special literal i.e., None.
                            None is used to specify to that field that is not created. 
                            It is also used for the end of lists in Python.

                            Python provides the four types of literal collection such as 
                            List literals, Tuple literals, Dict literals, and Set literals.

                        The operator can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a particular operation between two 
                        operands. Operators are the pillars of a program on which the logic is built in a specific 
                        programming language. Python provides a variety of operators, which are described as follows.

                        Python Comment is an essential tool for the programmers. Comments are generally used to explain the 
                        code. We can easily understand the code if it has a proper explanation. A good programmer must use 
                        the comments because in the future anyone wants to modify the code as well as implement the new module; 
                        then, it can be done easily.
                        In the other programming language such as C++, It provides the // for single-lined comment and /*.... */ 
                        for multiple-lined comment, but Python provides the single-lined Python comment. To apply the comment in 
                        the code we use the hash(#) at the beginning of the statement or code.
                        We can also use the triple quotes ('''''') for multiline comment. The triple quotes are also used to 
                        string formatting.

                        Decision making is the most important aspect of almost all the programming languages. As the 
                        name implies, decision making allows us to run a particular block of code for a particular decision. 
                        Here, the decisions are made on the validity of the particular conditions. Condition checking 
                        is the backbone of decision making.

                            except the fact that, it also provides the block of the code for the false case of the 
                            condition to be checked. If the condition 
                            provided in the if statement is false, then the else statement will be executed.

                            <strong>Nested if -</strong> Nested if statements enable us to use if, else statement inside an outer if statement.

                        The flow of the programs written in any programming language is sequential by default. Sometimes we may need to 
                        alter the flow of the program. The execution of a specific code may need to be repeated several numbers of times.
                        For this purpose, The programming languages provide various types of loops which are capable of repeating some 
                        specific code several numbers of times. Consider the following diagram to understand the working of a loop statement.

                            Using loops, we do not need to write the same code again and again.

                            Using loops, we can traverse over the elements of data structures (array or linked lists).

                    There are 3 loop statements in Python

                            <strong>for loop</strong>
                            <p>
                                The for loop is used in the case where we need to execute some part of the code until 
                                the given condition is satisfied. The for loop is also called as a per-tested loop. 
                                It is better to use for loop if the number of iteration is known in advance.
                                It is frequently used to traverse the data structures like list, tuple, or dictionary.

                                The while loop is to be used in the scenario where we don't know the number of iterations in advance. The block of statements is executed 
                                in the while loop until the condition specified in the while loop is satisfied. It is also called a pre-tested loop.

                                The do-while loop continues until a given condition satisfies. It is also called post tested loop. It is used 
                                when it is necessary to execute the loop at least once (mostly menu driven programs).

                <p>
                    The break is a keyword in python which is used to bring the program control out of the loop. The break 
                    statement breaks the loops one by one, i.e., in the case of nested loops, it breaks the inner loop first 
                    and then proceeds to outer loops. In other words, we can say that break is used to abort the current 
                    execution of the program and the control goes to the next line after the loop.
                    The break is commonly used in the cases where we need to break the loop for a given condition.
